## Question I try to answer
about characterizing events, stable pages, recurrent topics

## Explain RTD graph viz tool
* Where it comes from
* Why it has been implemented that way
* What it could bring us for our analysis

## Heatmaps
* Current events, exclusive types
* The dimensions weâ€™ll be playing with
* The limitations: Page level analysis, alpha parameter not optimized

{% include heatmap_dates.html %}

Explain axis, hover data, what it represents, what we can get from it

Explain each graph and comment
* Date : recurrent topics and topics brought up by events, noisy pages
N : comment on the graph silhouette
Alpha : explain spectrum + what we observe

## Divergence contribution plots
