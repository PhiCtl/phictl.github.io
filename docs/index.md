# Master thesis, overrides title defined in config

## Question I try to answer
about characterizing events, stable pages, recurrent topics

## Explain RTD graph viz tool
* Where it comes from
* Why it has been implemented that way
* What it could bring us for our analysis

## Throughout a year 
* Current events, exclusive types
* The dimensions weâ€™ll be playing with
* The limitations: Page level analysis, alpha parameter not optimized

### Heatmap

{% include heatmap_dates.html %}
**Figure 1.** Make title
Explain axis, hover data, what it represents, what we can get from it

Explain graph and comment
* Date : recurrent topics and topics brought up by events, noisy pages. Consecutive months : not enough exclusive types for a pattern to appear

### Divergence contribution plots

{% include divs_dates.html %}
**Figure 2.** Make title and comment. consecutive months !

{% include stats_dates.html %}
**Figure 3.** Make title and comment. Explain what each contribution represents, how it was computed.

## Focusing on 2 specific months

Explain graps
N : comment on the graph silhouette
Alpha : explain spectrum + what we observe
